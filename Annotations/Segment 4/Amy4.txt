"text": "hi guys .",
      "speaker": "A",
      "eduidx": 36,
      "turnidx": 1066
"text": "how are you doing ?",
      "speaker": "A",
      "eduidx": 37,
      "turnidx": 1067
"type": "Unrelated"

This was a random people disturbed the two people in a conversation,
after these two people said hello to the ramdom people,
they went back to the conversation.
So the relation here I used is "unrelated."



"text": "uhm (.) some lady named Judy or something like that +...",
      "speaker": "B",
      "eduidx": 61,
      "turnidx": 1288
"text": "Mum told me that there was a Judy that worked there .",
      "speaker": "A",
      "eduidx": 62,
      "turnidx": 1289
"type": "Enumeration"

This topic was an "enumeration" from the previous topic in Amy4-1030-%com.jsonfile.
The colleagues/students were talking about one girl kept being sick,
then another similar/related sotry was bringing out by the people in this topic.



"text": "that's right .",
      "speaker": "A",
      "eduidx": 1,
      "turnidx": 1527
"text": "<laugh> oh yeah .",
      "speaker": "A",
      "eduidx": 2,
      "turnidx": 1528
"type": "Meta"

The relation is "Meta" cause "That's right." and "oh yeah." is more like a comment.



In general, the topics content from work, small talk-gossip, study, birthday gifts to school life.
