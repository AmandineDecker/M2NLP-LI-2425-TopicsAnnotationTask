Between turn 63 and turn 64, the topic has been shifted from the tape to the story about he little chipmunk n the garage. The speaker used clue word “and”, so I flet like its bringing the narrative forward so I labeled it as continuation. 
General comments : The conversation includes many topic shifts, often moving between personal experiences and general discussions, or get interupted then got back to the topics. Tracking these transitions could be useful. And laughters are happening a lot.
